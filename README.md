A test of [the {sortable} package](https://rstudio.github.io/sortable/) to see how pliable it is to play card games with R using [{shiny} apps](https://shiny.posit.co/). Specifically, clicking and dragging 'cards' from a pool into your hand and then calculating a score given your selections.

[Available on the web](https://matt-dray.github.io/not-balatro/) and prepared for serverless deployment with [{shinylive}](https://posit-dev.github.io/r-shinylive/). Very much a work in progress/proof of concept.

<img src='img/cards.png' alt="Two rows of playing cards labelled 'pool' and 'hand'. The number of cards is shown as 4 out of 8 in the pool and 4 out of 5 in the hand. There is also a score of 30 points shown by the hand, which is the sum of each card's value (a two pair of queens and 4s).">
