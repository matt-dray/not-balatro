A test of [the {sortable} package](https://rstudio.github.io/sortable/) for R to see if we can use it to play drag-and-drop card games in [{shiny} apps](https://shiny.posit.co/).

[Available on the web](https://matt-dray.github.io/not-balatro/) and prepared for serverless deployment with [{shinylive}](https://posit-dev.github.io/r-shinylive/). Very much a work in progress/proof of concept.

<img src='img/cards.gif' alt="Two rows of playing cards labelled 'pool' and 'hand'. Buttons are pressed to order the cards by suit and then by rank. Cards are dragged from the pool to the hand. An ace is dragged and the text updates from 'no hand' to 'high card'. Another ace and it changes to 'a pair'. A 'draw' button is pressed and two new cards are added to the pool. The pool is ordered again by rank. Then two queens are added to the hand and the text changes to 'two pair'.">
