A test of [the {sortable} package](https://rstudio.github.io/sortable/) to see how pliable it is to play card games with R using [{shiny} apps](https://shiny.posit.co/). Specifically, clicking and dragging 'cards' from a pool into your hand and then calculating a score given your selections.

[Available on the web](https://matt-dray.github.io/not-balatro/) and prepared for serverless deployment with [{shinylive}](https://posit-dev.github.io/r-shinylive/). Very much a work in progress/proof of concept.

<img src='img/full-house.gif' alt="Two rows of playing cards labelled 'pool' and 'hand'. Cards are dragged from the pool to the hand. A three is dragged and the text updates from 'no hand' to 'high card'. Another three and it changes to 'a pair'. Then two kings and it changes to 'two pair'. Finally a third king is added and it updates to say 'full house'.">
